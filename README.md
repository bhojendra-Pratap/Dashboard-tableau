## 📊 Key Insights & Conclusion

- 💹 **Sales Performance Increased Steadily** over the months, with significant spikes during Q3 and Q4 — likely due to festive season promotions.
- 🥇 **Top-Selling Products** contributed disproportionately to total revenue, indicating a classic Pareto distribution (80/20 rule).
- 🌏 **North and West regions** performed best, suggesting regional strategies could be optimized further for underperforming zones.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **High Order Volume ≠ High Revenue** in some regions, which hints at lower average order values — a key opportunity for upselling.
- 📦 **Product Category C** outperformed others in both volume and revenue, making it an area for focused marketing campaigns.

> ✅ **Conclusion:** The dashboard enables faster and data-driven decision-making by consolidating important KPIs and trends in one place. It can serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders to monitor business health and strategize effectively.
