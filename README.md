##  Key Insights & Conclusion

-  **Sales Performance Increased Steadily** over the months, with significant spikes during Q3 and Q4 — likely due to festive season promotions.
-  **Top-Selling Products** contributed disproportionately to total revenue, indicating a classic Pareto distribution (80/20 rule).
-  **North and West regions** performed best, suggesting regional strategies could be optimized further for underperforming zones.
-  **High Order Volume ≠ High Revenue** in some regions, which hints at lower average order values — a key opportunity for upselling.
-  **Product Category C** outperformed others in both volume and revenue, making it an area for focused marketing campaigns.

>  **Conclusion:** The dashboard enables faster and data-driven decision-making by consolidating important KPIs and trends in one place. It can serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders to monitor business health and strategize effectively.
